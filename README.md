# Advant of Code 2023 Solutions

```
I'm planning to pick Go lang for the Advent of Code. I haven't used it in a while[1] so I'm feeling a bit
excited. Recently I came across a bunch of prototype code (in distributed systems space) written in it so
motivation is to get enough muscle memory to read them effortlessly. 
```

### check solution
```bash
go run aoc2023.go -- --day <day> --part <part>
```

`<day>` expects a number between 1 and 25.
`<part>` (optional; default: 1) expects either 1 or 2.

### run tests
```bash
go test ./day1
```

`day1` is a module.
